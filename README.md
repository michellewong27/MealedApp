This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Description: Mealed is a recipe scheduling application that spices up users' everyday meal routines by searching recipes and scheduling them on their own personal calendar. Each user is able to share their own recipes they have up their sleeve with the community add items to their grocery list, and favorite other individual's recipes to save for later.

Technologies/ Frameworks Used: For the frontend, this application implemented React coupled with CSS to design a functional user interface. Mealed integrated the Spoonacular API to pull and parse recipe data in addition to conducting a Rails backend to have users craft their own recipe data. Material UI was employed for the date/time capabilities when scheduling a new recipe to put on the calendar. React Big Calendar was applied to allow users to have a calendar layout with the recipes visualized in an organized structure.
